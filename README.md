# Contacts_app
My contacts app is built using Kotlin. It utilizes concepts such Data Access Object(DAO),database,Coroutines,MVVM archtecture (Model View View Model),RecyclerView and Adapter.
I used DAO to serve as an interface for querying data,MVVM architecture for clear separation of concerns ,Recycler views to display contacts in a scrollable view.
I have also added the functionality to view contacts details .
